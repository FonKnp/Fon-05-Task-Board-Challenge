This challege is to create a simple task board application that allows a team to manage project tasks. This project is a lot of third party APIs. I learn that Jquery function are more useful and easy to use. I learn bootstrap css property. I learn what are the correct form and modal. I learn how to put a different class element in the html that link to bootstrap. I learn how to link html to bootstrap, Jquery, Jquery UI, and Google font UI. I learn how Jquery function work in JavaScript. It is really complicate when use all of these together.
